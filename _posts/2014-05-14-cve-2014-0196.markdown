A new kernel bug has been discovered that allows local users to possibly corrupt memory causing a system crash or gain super user privileges by triggering a race condition with the tty driver involving read and write operations with long strings. Administrators of Linux are advised to upgrade any kernel from 2.6.31-rc3 to 3.14.3 as soon as possible.
