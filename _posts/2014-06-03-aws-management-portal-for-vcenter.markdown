> AWS Management Portal for vCenter enables you to manage your AWS resources using VMware vCenter. The portal installs as a vCenter plug-in within your existing vCenter environment. Once installed, it enables you to migrate VMware VMs to Amazon EC2 and manage AWS resources from within vCenter. The AWS resources that you create using the portal will be located in your AWS account, even though they have been created using vCenter. For experienced VMware administrators, AWS Management Portal for vCenter provides a familiar look-and-feel that will make it easy to start using AWS. For enterprises with existing VMware-based environments, the portal makes it easy to begin moving computing resources to the cloud, while continuing to leverage existing tools and training materials while beginning their transition. Service providers that offer VMware-based services can also use the portal to offer their end customers self-service access to AWS.
