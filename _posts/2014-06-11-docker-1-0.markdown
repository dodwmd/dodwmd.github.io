Previously I wrote about docker (<a href="https://dodwell.us/docker/" title="What is docker?">here</a>). I'm now excited to inform you that Docker 1.0 has been released.

> On March 20, 2013, we released the first version of Docker.  After 15 months, 8,741 commits from more than 460 contributors, 2.75 million downloads, over 14,000 &ldquo;Dockerized&rdquo; apps, and feedback from 10s of 1000s of users about their experience with Docker, from a single container on a laptop to 1000s in production in the cloud &hellip; we&rsquo;re excited to announce that it&rsquo;s here: Docker 1.0.
