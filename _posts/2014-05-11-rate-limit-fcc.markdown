I came across an interesting plan by a group of webmasters to rate limit the speed of hosted sites for members of the FCC so they could get a taste of what the end of Net Neutrality would mean.

The webmasters are rate limiting all web requests to their hosts if the users are coming from FCC IP addresses. The code to limit has been posted on a gist <a href="https://gist.github.com/kyledrake/e6046644115f185f7af0" title="How to throttle the FCC to dial up modem speeds on your website using Nginx" target="_blank">here.</a>
