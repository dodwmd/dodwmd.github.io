                                <p align="justify"><i>Accenture is a management consulting, technology services and outsourcing company helping clients in Australia become high-performing</i>
I was brought on to Accenture to help augment and build their DevOps practice. Accenture wanted to develop a practice in the Australasian and Pacific region(s) to meet client demand. During my first assignment, I was able to create a small team with a major Telecommunications provider helping them to establish an automation framework for the provisioning of infrastructure to assist in the acquisition of new customers onto their hosted environments. By developing a python framework using Fabric, I was able to manage the configuration of their existing hardware to allow for the automated provision of new clients. This increased the turnaround for new account signups to be a matter of minutes rather than days. I also served as a mentor and guide for both client and Accenture staff; primarily in the DevOps practice. I was also part of an Openstack proposal and worked closely with Red Hat Solutions Architects in how we were able to bring this to market under the Telecommunications provider’s banner.
FINANCIAL SECTOR
Within the financial sector I helped design, and architect a proposal for a project; which was to automate the creation of environments to help service the internally developed software lifecycle for the Core Banking products utilised by the institution. During the accepted proposal; I acted as the Delivery Manager for a group of engineers, which spanned a collaborative network of global staff and external vendors. Upon completion of the project the team had managed to improve the deployment(s) 10-fold and allowed for the migration of on-prem environments to AWS. This work enabled a massive cost reduction to environment deployments which enabled a higher concurrency of development work to be carried out and a massive cost reduction to the purchase of new hardware to service these environments. 
GOVERNMENT SECTOR
Currently, I am working out of the main Brisbane office on a project for a government department where I am directly responsible for a large group of System Engineers. Here I assist the training and act as the oversight for DevOps transformation. The core work that is being carried out is to migrate to the cloud agnostically. With a limited approach to services offered by providers (IAAS) we are able to utilise products like vRealize to build templates that are able to be built on a subset of selected cloud providers. I was further able to guide and educate staff in how to operate using Agile/DevOps methodologies and practices. Working with the Release Train I was also able to reorganize the existing feature and systems teams to create 6 cross-functional teams able to meet future business needs under SAFE.

                                I was asked to join the Outware team to help solve some directional problems they were having with their build environments. This role required me to work directly with one of Outware's major clients, ANZ, finding a solution that would meet both ANZ’s and Outware's requirements for a stable/secure build environment. The existing build environment required major rework and while contracting at Outware I was able to complete all necessary planning and implementation of the recreation of the environment. This work consisted of upgrades to the OS/virtualization/CI and implementation of better testing framework/build reporting. This work also required generic pattern setup to allow for use with other clients.

                                My role at Geoplex consisted of the creation and automation of server environments capable of real-time monitoring of assets for the waste management industry.

The original role required working with 3rd party providers to create a solution but later pivoted to use an existing solution from a supplier based out of the USA. The role required me to carry out a detailed analysis of the solution to confirm that it would fit into an Australian market. The role also required to deploy the solution into a shared hosting environment on an extremely short deadline. The hosting provider had to be selected and worked with to ensure compliance with PCI-DSS. The network consisted of over 10 environments, each environment being a sandbox to enable testing without interrupting or impacting production systems. The environment's where setup via custom built orchestration tools and puppet consisting mainly of CentOS instances. While this work was happening a local software provider was also commissioned to build front end applications that better suited the Australian market. Support for this development process was also required.</p>

Most clients have existing infrastructure before hiring Hyperlink to manage their services. This meant that each client had separate environments and each had separate SOE. One of the larger clients, who were the original owners when I started, was ASG whom had 3 different SAN's connected via fibre controllers to a large VMware ESX farm that hosted around 100 virtual guests. Other clients used hardware and infrastructure provided by Hyperlink while other clients had hardware housed in-house but was managed by us. Hyperlink also had an internal VMware ESX cluster as well as single dedicated ESX hosts with a small number of VM's created. Hyperlink also offered shared web and mail stores. The hardware ranged from Sun (4500, 4600), HP DL380's, IBM x3755's to HP P-class blade chassis and a lot of miscellaneous pieces of gear.

Therefore, my role in this project encompassed the following components: The load was balanced by a Radware WSD that was constantly going faulty and required a manual flushing of ARP tables to reset it to a sane state. The web-stack is backed into Resin (java application server) and Zeus (web server). The database system was run out of a cluster of MySQL servers held together with EAC cluster technology.
