<h2>Outware</h2>

<h4>October 2014 – Feburary 2015</h4>
<p align="justify"><i>Outware Mobile is Australia's leading mobile app development and design company. Custom app developers for iPhone, iPad and Android.</i></br>
I was asked to join the Outware team to help solve some directional problems they where having with their build environments. This required working with one of their major clients ANZ to find a solution that would meet both ANZ and Outware requirements for a build environment. One of the immediate problems was that due to software restrictions on OSX which is required to compile IOS apps we where limited to how many virtual machines could run on hardware and that the hardware had to be supplied by Apple. We also had restrictions to the type of CI being used and poor performance from the preselected vitalization that had been selected.

Geoplex brings a clear thinking approach to the projects they work on, by rationalising problems, and carefully designing solutions.</i></br>
My role at Geoplex consisted of the creation and automation of server environments capable of real-time monitoring of assets for the waste management industry. This was enabled through the installation of monitoring hardware installed on all trucks that would send GPS location and status information back to a centralized database, which was frequently queried “in real-time” for reporting and tracking analysis tasks, utilised by both company and council. Analysis data included photographic-proof of incidents. On average nearly a million records of real-time activity are recorded per month.</p>

Australia Post has a project to create a Digital Mailbox within Australia called Redbox. The role was created to manage the operational requirement to bring to market a new solution. The original role required working with 3rd party providers to create a solution but later pivoted to use an existing solution from a supplier based out of the USA. The role required me to carry out a detailed analysis of the solution to confirm that it would fit into an Australian market. The role also required to deploy the solution into a shared hosting environment on an extremely short deadline. The hosting provider had to be selected and worked with to ensure compliance with PCI-DSS. The network consisted of over 10 environments, each environment being a sandbox to enable testing without interrupting or impacting production systems. The environment's where setup via custom built orchestration tools and puppet consisting mainly of CentOS instances. While this work was happening a local software provider was also commissioned to build front end applications that better suited the Australian market. Support for this development process was also required.</p>

The in-house environment consists of mainly Dell servers with networking provided by Jupiter networks. The business also hosts infrastructure of clients so the variety is quite large. SAN's are used to provide bulk storage for backup and provisioning to clients for virtual machine use.

<h3>UNIX Systems Administrator</h3>
<h4>June 2010 - March 2011</h4>
<p align="justify"><i>Hyperlink is one of Australia's leading providers of managed infrastructure, private network connectivity, website design and maintenance, and hosting services.</i></br>
Hyperlink's environment is a mix and match environment due to the nature of the business. Most clients have existing infrastructure before hiring Hyperlink to manage their services. This meant that each client had separate environments and each had separate SOE. One of the larger clients, who were the original owners when I started, was ASG whom had 3 different SAN's connected via fibre controllers to a large VMware ESX farm that hosted around 100 virtual guests. Other clients used hardware and infrastructure provided by Hyperlink while other clients had hardware housed in-house but was managed by us. Hyperlink also had an internal VMware ESX cluster as well as single dedicated ESX hosts with a small number of VM's created. Hyperlink also offered shared web and mail stores. The hardware ranged from Sun (4500, 4600), HP DL380's, IBM x3755's to HP P-class blade chassis and a lot of miscellaneous pieces of gear. The core operating system used was Redhat closely complemented by Open Solaris.</p>

These servers are mission critical to the web-portal interactive environment and must be maintained 24/7. I was brought into the anywebcam.com team to help with an existing web architecture setup that was in a critical state at my time of arrival. Therefore, my role in this project encompassed the following components: The load was balanced by a Radware WSD that was constantly going faulty and required a manual flushing of ARP tables to reset it to a sane state. The web-stack is backed into Resin (java application server) and Zeus (web server). The database system was run out of a cluster of MySQL servers held together with EAC cluster technology. In the initial few months I was at AWC I had to carry out sweeping changes to the network and sub-systems to improve uptime and reliability.</p>
